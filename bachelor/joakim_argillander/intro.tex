%The introduction shall be divided into these sections:

\section{Motivation}
\label{sec:motivation}

% \cite{scigen}

% Behöver referens



%This is where the studied problem is described from a general
%point of view and put in a context which makes it clear that
%it is interesting and well worth studying. The aim is to make
%the reader interested in the work and create an urge to
%continue reading.

\section{Målsättning}
\label{sec:aim}
Målsättningen med denna avhandling är att redogöra för-, och nackdelar med agil testningsmetodik och hur man kan anpassa detta till småskalig mjukvaruutveckling.


%What is the underlying purpose of the thesis project?

\section{Frågeställningar}
\label{sec:research-questions}
\begin{itemize}
\item Hur kan garantier lämnas om ett mjukvarusystem av utvecklare utan tidigare erfarenhet av mjukvarutestning?
\item Hur genomförs testning så att belastningen på utvecklare blir minimal? 
\end{itemize}

%This is where the research questions are described.
%Formulate these as explicit questions, terminated with a
%question mark. A report will usually contain several different
%research questions that are somehow thematically connected.
%There are usually 2-4 questions in total.

%Examples of common types of research questions (simplified
%and generalized):



%Observe that a very specific research question almost always
%leads to a better thesis report than a general research question
%(it is simply much more difficult to make something good
%from a general research question.)

%The best way to achieve a really good and specific research
%question is to conduct a thorough literature review and get
%familiarized with related research and practice. This leads to
%ideas and terminology which allows one to express oneself
%with precision and also have something valuable to say in the
%discussion chapter. And once a detailed research question
%has been specified, it is much easier to establish a suitable
%method and thus carry out the actual thesis work much faster
%than when starting with a fairly general research question. In
%the end, it usually pays off to spend some extra time in the
%beginning working on the literature review. The thesis
%supervisor can be of assistance in deciding when the research
%question is sufficiently specific and well-grounded in related
%research.

\section{Avgränsningar}
\label{sec:delimitations}
Undersökningen baseras på det projektarbete som utförts som en del av kursen TDDD96 - Programutvecklingsmetodik under våren 2017.\\
\\
Verktyg och ramverk som används utgår från användandet av JavaScript-webramverket Meteor och är avgränsat till projekt baserat på nämnda ramverk. 

%This is where the main delimitations are described. For
%example, this could be that one has focused the study on a
%specific application domain or target user group. In the
%normal case, the delimitations need not be justified.

%\nocite{scigen}
%We have included Paper \ref{art:scigen}
